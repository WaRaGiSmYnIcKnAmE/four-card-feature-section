### What I learned

In the process of completing this challenge, I encountered the problem of reducing fonts to fit the screen size. At the moment, I have solved this with the help of media queries.

```css
@media (max-width: 1080px) {
    h2 {
        font-size: 2rem;
    }
}

@media (max-width: 500px) {
    h2 {
        font-size: 1.5rem;
    }
}
```
